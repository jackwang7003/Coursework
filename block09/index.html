        <h2>When I began my first job as a test engineer in 1992, I found my interesting in computer science. 
            During the working, I have some opportunities to develop some applications using C language. 
            These applications are collecting testing data automatically and being processed to get test results. 
            I am proud of my outcomes because they really make a progress in testing. 
            After I came to the United States in 2015, I was a contractor of product safety consultation and evaluation. 
            I also accumulated experience in IT management.
